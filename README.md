This Python program provides a comprehensive solution for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts to make informed decisions about crop selection, fertilizer usage, and pest management. The tool integrates crop-specific recommendations with weather data, market prices, and pest information to support better agricultural practices.

How It Works
Input Requirements:
City name for fetching weather data.
Soil type and pH value for crop recommendations.
Crop selection for pest information.
Outputs:
List of crops suitable for the given conditions.
Fertilizer recommendations for each crop.
Real-time weather conditions in the user's location.
Pest details and associated images for the selected crop.
Market prices for crops (static data in this implementation).
APIs Used:

OpenWeatherMap API: Fetches real-time weather data.
Google Custom Search API: Retrieves pest images (requires an API key and search engine ID).
AgriWatch Scraping: Demonstrates how real-time crop prices could be fetched using web scraping.
Future Enhancements:
Integration with live APIs for real-time crop prices.
Expand pest database with additional pests and region-specific information.
Advanced pest detection using machine learning and image recognition.
